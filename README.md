# real-estate-finance

These are a collection of scripts I created in the context of assignments during my Master's degree in Banking & Finance at the University of St. Gallen in courses such as 'Empirical Real Estate Finance' and 'Real Estate Finance'.

The files used for Assignment 2 were downloaded for the State Government of Victoria's website.
