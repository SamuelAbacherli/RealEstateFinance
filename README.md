# real-estate-finance

These are a collection of scripts I created in the context of assignments during my Master's degree in Banking & Finance at the University of St. Gallen.

The courses are:

- Empirical Real Estate Finance (EREF)
- Real Estate Economics (REE)
- Real Estate Finance (REF)

Personally, I enjoyed Empirical Real Estate Finance the most, followed by Real Estate Economics.

The data files used for EREF_Assignment_2 were downloaded for the State Government of Victoria's website.
